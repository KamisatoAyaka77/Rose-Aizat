          <br></br>
          <p> 2017 until 2019 was the best year of my life because i just finish my big exam which is the SPM and i was excited to find a job and get my own money with my own hardwork, those years has been my best year because i can do anything i want whenever i want before the pandemic happens and ruins everything
          <p> I started continue my studies in 2019 after 1 year break from SPM, and it was going well for a year until the pandemic begin and all of us students need to continue our study online which is affect all of us. Having to study online is kinda hard for the first few months, but now, i already used to it but it still affects my mental health and also my grade. I was hoping for these pandemic to be over very soon because i want to continue my degree in peace.
